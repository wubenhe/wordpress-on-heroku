Launch Effect Premium is a viral marketing theme for WordPress empowering designers, marketers, and enthusiasts to build websites with relative ease.

== Description ==

Launch Effect Premium is a viral marketing theme for WordPress that empowers web designers, marketers, and WordPress enthusiasts to build beautiful, fully-featured websites without touching a single line of code.  A built-in referral link generator integrated with MailChimp, Aweber, and Campaign Monitor allows visitors to your website to sign up with their emails and use the unique link generated by the theme to spread the word about your site.  It's up to you to think of brilliant ways to incentivize your visitors to share their link!  Its robust theme options panel gives you the ability to customize almost every aspect of the design and comes fully-loaded with Google web font, Typekit and Monotype web font integration.  Enjoy!

== Installation ==

After normal theme installation, follow the below steps to get LaunchEffect up and running.

1. Set Homepage: Go to Settings > Reading.
By default, WordPress shows your most recent Posts (the blog) on the homepage of your site (like the one you’re reading right now). But many WordPress users want to be able to choose a different Page as their homepage.

If you’d like to keep your most recent Posts as your homepage, you don’t have to adjust anything in this step.

If not, where it says, “Front page displays,” choose “A static page,” and select accordingly for your “Front Page”. Be sure to select “Blog” for “Posts Page”. If you’d like the Launch Effect sign-up page to be your homepage, choose “Sign-Up” for “Front Page”. Go to the Pages item in the WordPress sidebar to create new pages, which you can also select to be your “Front Page”.

2. Create Nav Menu: Go to Appearance > Menus.

This is where your navigation menu is set up and controlled. In the large panel on the right, next to “Menu Name,” write a name for your menu (it can be anything) and press save. The page will refresh and you will see a new panel called “Theme Locations at the top left. Use the Launch Effect Navigation drop down menu to select the name of the menu you just created. Then press save. Now you can use the options at left to choose what pages and posts you’d like to appear in your nav menu.

3. Select Widgets: Go to Appearance > Widgets.

Launch Effect is compatible with the standard WordPress widgets, as you can see from the ones that appear by default on the left-hand side of your website. Here you can select which widgets to keep and which to remove, as well as customize content specific to each widget.

4. Start Designing: Go to Launch Effect > Designer.

Now for the fun part! The Designer is now divided into three sections: Global Styles, Sign-Up Page, and Theme. That submenu is located directly under the giant Designer/Integrations/Stats tabs. The best way to get started here is to just start playing around and gaining an understanding of what selections affect which parts of the design. Good luck!
